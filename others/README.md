Various files which are not necessary needed for development:

- robodocada.rc   - configuration file to generate development documentation
- robodoc.css     - CSS for code documentation
- generatedocs.py - script to generate code documentation. **Important:** run
                    this script from the main project directory, not from this.
- build.cmd       - script used to build Windows version of the program on
                    Linux. You will probably have to change PATH variable
                    inside if you want o run it.
- build.sh        - script to build Linux release for the program. Build the
                    program in release mode and copy all files to proper
                    location.
